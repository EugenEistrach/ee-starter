# How to Write Documentation

## Principles

1. **Concise** - No redundant information, get straight to the point
2. **Timeless** - Write generalized examples that work across projects
3. **Low maintenance** - Automate updates via scripts when feasible
4. **Avoid duplication** - Check existing docs before creating new ones

## Structure
- `docs/how-to/` - Step-by-step processes and workflows
- `docs/references/` - General information and reference material

## Before Creating New Docs

1. Check if existing doc can be updated instead
2. Question if the doc is really needed
3. Consider if information fits better in existing structure

## Writing Guidelines

**Show, don't tell:**
- Lead with how to do things, not how to avoid mistakes
- Use examples to demonstrate processes
- Focus on the correct approach rather than listing wrong approaches

**Action-focused (how-to guides):**
- Focus on the process and workflow
- Use clear step numbers
- Keep project-specific details minimal unless explicitly needed

**Timeless examples:**
- Generalize code examples
- Don't reference specific versions or dates
- Make it reusable in other projects

**Automation opportunities:**
- If content can be auto-generated, recommend it
- Only if genuinely feasible and maintainable

**Self-contained writing:**
- Explain context or provide clear references
- If mentioning project-specific tools/scripts, link to them or explain what they are
- Write so future readers understand without assumed knowledge
